= Eclipse Language Services =

Start point for documentation related to https://github.com/eclipselabs/eclipse-language-service[eclipse language services]

The idea is to have a proof of concept of Language Services on Eclipse by: 

* implementing a subclass of SSE Structured Editor that sends data to a language service

As protocol we refer to the https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-protocol[vscode languageserver protocol], implemented under MIT license by the team of https://github.com/egamma[E.Gamma,  (MicroSoft)] .


== Server Side ==

Protocol: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-protocol 

The easiest way to have a language server running is to install VSCode: http://code.visualstudio.com/

. How to run the JavaScript language server
. Start VSCode
. Clone a git repo with JS code: https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs
. Open the cloned folder in VSCode

== Eclipse IDE Side ==

We choose to start implementing a JavaScript Editor as VSCode already provides a Language Server Service for a JavaScript editor. 
You can extend this by adding any other editor, as example XML, Java, Xtext, PHP, HTML, XSLT, SASS, etc.  

* We created a plugin `org.eclipse.lsp4e`, which implements an extension to `org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.ui.javaCompletionProposalComputer`. 
* The LanguageCompletionProposalComputer#computeCompletionProposals(..) is the method that actually provides content assist.
* To run, you need to setup for JSDT, explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOz1hk-ohMA
