TODO:
* finish up handling of running events ^running and *running
* track whether or not debuggee is stopped or running

BACKLOG:
* client should take arguments from user, e.g. target, attach or launch, working dir, etc.
* client should take input and output streams as args
* figure out (understand how it works) how to override threadpool like in DSPDebugTarget
